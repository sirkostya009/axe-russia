# Map of decomposable Russia

Active WIP.

## Running

If you're new to Svelte, and don't know how to run this project, don't worry: it's very easy.

First, you need to install all of the dependencies. I have been using pnpm cause I find it to be slightly
better for this, but you can use npm, too. Just don't commit the `package-lock`.

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then you should run the development build:

```bash
npx vite dev
```

Of course, if you have vite installed globally you don't have to run it via `npx` but instead invoke `vite` directly.

Also, if you wish to preview it on your phone separately as well, or any other physical device for that matter, you will
need to pass an additional `--host` argument.
